What is engine?
===============

engine is a collection of tools for processing a queue. It provides an API to
defer a callable and run it later. engine also provides process helpers to
set up a safe environment for clearing different kind of queues.

How do I use engine?
====================

The basic usage of engine is to defer something to execute later. However, the
internals are written in such way to allow for planning. You can plan your
code to use a queue, but a queue doesn't even need to be present. Lets take a
look at an example::

    >>> import engine
    >>> def hello_world():
    ...     print "hello world"
    
    >>> engine.defer(hello_world)
    hello world
